# README
This repository contains various projects that we have built together at the
[Munich CCC (Âµc3) Rust Group](https://wiki.muc.ccc.de/rust).  We usually build
these projects in mob coding sessions[^1], facilitated by the use of
[mob.sh](https://mob.sh/).

[^1]: Mob coding/programming is a form of team programming that is well suited for our kind of open-ended evenings :)
