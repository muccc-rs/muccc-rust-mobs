Operator precedence in Lua follows the table below, from lower to higher priority:
    or
    and
    <     >     <=    >=    ~=    ==
    |
    ~
    &
    <<    >>
    ..
    +     -
    *     /     //    %
    unary operators (not   #     -     ~)
    ^

As usual, you can use parentheses to change the precedences of an expression. The concatenation ('..') and exponentiation ('^') operators are right associative. All other binary operators are left associative.
